Baggage rules for an interline journey
As per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), baggage rules for an interline journey are as follows:

Step 1: If the published provisions for baggage allowance among all participating carriers are the same, then those provisions will apply.

Step 2: When one or more published baggage provisions differ between participating carriers, apply any common provisions. When all provisions differ, apply the published baggage provisions of the Most Significant Carrier (MSC). In the case of codeshare flights, this will be the operating carrier unless that carrier publishes a rule stipulating that it will be the marketing carrier.

Step 3: If the MSC does not publish baggage provisions for the journey concerned, apply the published baggage provisions of the carrier accepting the baggage at check-in.

Step 4: Determine the MSC:

For travel between two or more IATA areas, the carrier on the first sector crosses from one area to another. 
Exception: IATA Area 1/2/3 only, the carrier providing carriage on the first sector crosses between IATA Area 1 and IATA Area 2.
For travel between IATA tariff sub-areas, the carrier in the first sector crosses from one sub-area to another.
For travel within an IATA tariff sub-area, it is the carrier in the first international sector.
When a passenger chooses to take a stopover at a connecting point, a new baggage assessment and charges may apply from the point of departure following the stopover.

Here are some more things to keep in mind:

Infants in all classes are eligible for baggage allowance of up to 10 kg/22 lb of one piece.
The maximum weight permissible for a single piece of baggage is 32 kg/71 lb. This rule applies to the entire Air India network.
For tickets issued effective 01 April 2019, free baggage allowance in economy class between India and Newark (EWR) is one piece of up to 23 kg/51 lb.

Silver members are eligible for additional baggage allowance on flights operated by Air India only, whereas Gold and Platinum members (corresponding to Star Gold) are eligible for additional baggage allowance on Star Alliance flights as well.
